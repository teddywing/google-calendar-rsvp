NAME
----
google-calendar-rsvp - RSVP to a Google Calendar event

SYNOPSIS
--------
'google-calendar-rsvp' [options] [-y | -n | -m] [--email] [event_ids...]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
RSVP to a Google Calendar event. Events are specified by their ID or by their
EID.

An event ID looks like:

	1g4j1h67ndq7kddrb2bptp2cua

EIDs are more common, found in invitation emails and event URLs:

	MWc0ajFoNjduZHE3a2RkcmIyYnB0cDJjdWEgcm9yeS5tZXJjdXJ5QGV4YW1wbGUuY28K

An EID is a base64-encoded pair of values consisting of the event ID and most
or all of the organiser's email address.

Both event IDs and EIDs can be passed as command line arguments to RSVP to
those events. EIDs can also be read from an email given on standard input if
the '--email' flag is present. This allows an invitation email to be sent
directly to the program to avoid having to extract the EID separately.

To RSVP to an event, use the '--yes', '--no', or '--maybe' flags. The flag
applies to all events passed to the program. If more than one RSVP flag is
present, the rightmost one is used.

AUTHENTICATION
--------------
Authentication is required to make requests to the Google Calendar API. Before
the program can be used, users must create a Google project, and an OAuth 2
client ID. The Google project must enable the Google Calendar API.

The OAuth client ID should be downloaded as a JSON file to:

	$HOME/.local/share/google-calendar-rsvp/oauth-secret.json

On the first run of the program, you will be asked to visit a Google URL to
create a token and authorise scopes for the Google Calendar API. At this
point, the program will have the required authentication and authorisation
prerequisites to operate.

OPTIONS
-------
-y, --yes::
	Accept the event invitation.

-n, --no::
	Decline the event invitation.

-m, --maybe::
	Tentatively accept the event invitation.

--email::
	Read a Google Calendar invitation email from standard input and extract
	the event ID from the email instead of having to provide it as a command
	line argument.

-v, --verbose::
	Enable verbose output.

-h, --help::
	Print usage help.

-V, --version::
	Print the program version.
